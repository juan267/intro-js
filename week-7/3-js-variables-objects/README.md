# U3.W7: JavaScript Variables and Object Types

## Learning Competencies
- Define local variables in JavaScript
- Create objects of different types in JavaScript
- Create and add objects to an array in JavaScript
- Use pre-written tests to drive development

## Summary
Now that you have learned a bit about JavaScript, it's time to use that knowledge a bit more. In this challenge you will be creating a series of variables. The values of the variables will be different types of JavaScript objects. Since you've already worked with variables a bit in the last challenge, this challenge should be mostly review.


## Releases

## Release 1: Code it!
When you encounter the errors, write the code to pass the tests. When it passes, repeat the process until there aren't any errors left.

Hint: If you get an error message that says something like ...

`ReferenceError: secretNumber is not defined`, try declaring a variable with that name (e.g., `secretNumber`).

All tests will log `true` in the console when they pass--`false`, otherwise.

## Release 2: Commit and push
Once you have added your code, push your solutions to GitHub.

## Release 3: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md)
